# "When staying at home is not an option" - SocialOut
#### By Guillem Garc√≠a

This design is the result of a week's work on a university project. 

SocialOut is an app that allows users to socialise with people through outdoor events. Everyone is able to create an event, taking into account the air quality of the area to monitor health, and share it with their friends.

Without further ado, here are the designs of the main features, I hope you like them :)

I would like to thanks **Manuel Navid** for being an awesome teammate.
