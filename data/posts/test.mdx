# How to Price Yourself as a Freelance Developer

<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4hQU2yYQHkkqYanTOJChfg.jpeg' alt='test'/>

It’s been 6 years since I started my freelancing career as a full-stack developer in Tokyo. In recent years I work for companies only 30% of a year and 70% is assigned for my personal projects like Inkdrop while I still make the same income. I love my life style. What made it possible is project-based pricing, not hourly pricing.

I usually work with start-up companies. First I get started from having a meeting with them and suggest what I can help in their project. My scope of the work would be wide and various at each project such as designing UI, building front-end, back-end, mobile apps, operating databases, data analytics, etc. Once my scope has been decided I make a quotation for the work and propose it to the client.

It’s easy for freelance developers to price themselves with an hourly rate, and most of them start out with it. You don’t need to have negotiations with this pricing. But if you are a well-experienced developer, rethink about your pricing strategies because you are losing your income. We are not like a crew working at a conveyor belt, so you should be tied the price of the project to the client’s end result, not to the time you worked. With the project-based fees, I get more time for my personal projects instead of getting less fees when I finished the work fast with efficient ways while the client was happy because the end result is all that the client cares about.

But how to determine how much to charge? There is no formula, no rules, and no perfect way to do it. But there’re a handful of criteria to make up your pricing for every client that I will explain in a moment.

## Trust yourself

After understanding the client’s request, you will consider what your tasks will look like and evaluate them with 4 criteria: Efficiency, urgency, specialty and effectiveness. But it’s important to have your desired price before you think about these criteria, that is, how much you expect this client to pay.

The desired price is affected by your confidence a lot. Your lack of confidence came across as lowering price because you want to avoid having responsibility to your work. You need sufficient self-confidence by having many successful experiences as possible so that you can propose the right price you would think, or you will never be able to satisfy with your proposal. Just trust yourself.

## Know your market price roughlys

Well, you have a desired price as a subjective perspective, and it’s better to know the market price as an objective perspective. But don’t refer to your salary when you were working at a company because your salary doesn’t include any costs for the office space, welfare benefits, budgets for buying laptops. Freelancers have to pay for them by themselves, so you should include them in your quotation.
Referring to your friends who also work as a freelance is good way to know the market price. For example, an expert Ruby on Rails engineer is getting paid 7,260 USD per month. But only I can refer to him because I know him who lives in Tokyo, could work fast and could be good at management. The price would be higher in San Francisco.
So it’s enough to know it roughly just for getting reasons for your price.

## Determining how much to charge

Once you have both subjective and objective perspectives of the price, let’s evaluate your work based on 4 criteria to make up your pricing.
